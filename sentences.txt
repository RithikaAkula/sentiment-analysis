It's eleven o'clock
That is exactly what happened
I'm on my way to the meeting
I wonder what this is about
The airplane is almost full
Maybe tomorrow it will be cold
I would like a new alarm clock
I think I have a doctor's appointment
Don't forget a jacket
I think I've seen this before
The surface is slick
We'll stop in a couple of minutes
